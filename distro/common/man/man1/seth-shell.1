T{
Solo
T}	T{
seth\-shell acts as a seth\-solo client. It attempts to load the seth\-solo configuration file and JSON attributes. If the JSON attributes set a run list, it will be honored. Cookbooks will be loaded in the same way that seth\-solo loads them. seth\-solo mode is activated with the \fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-solo\fP command line option, and JSON attributes are specified in the same way as for seth\-solo, with \fB\-j /path/to/seth\-solo.json\fP\&.
T}
_
T{
Client
T}	T{
seth\-shell acts as a seth\-client\&. During startup, it reads the seth\-client configuration file and contacts the Seth server to get attributes and cookbooks. The run list will be set in the same way as normal seth\-client runs. seth\-client mode is activated with the \fB\-z\fP or \fB\-\-client\fP options. You can also specify the configuration file with \fB\-c CONFIG\fP and the server URL with \fB\-S SERVER_URL\fP\&.
