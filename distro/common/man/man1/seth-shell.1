.sp
seth\-shell is tool that allows Knife to be run using an Interactive Ruby (IRb) session. chef\-shell currently supports recipe and attribute file syntax, as well as interactive debugging features. chef\-shell has three run modes:

Description
T}
_
T{
Standalone
T}	T{
No cookbooks are loaded, and the run list is empty. This mode is the default.
T}
_
T{
Solo
T}	T{
seth\-shell acts as a chef\-solo client. It attempts to load the chef\-solo configuration file and JSON attributes. If the JSON attributes set a run list, it will be honored. Cookbooks will be loaded in the same way that chef\-solo loads them. chef\-solo mode is activated with the \fB\-s\fP or \fB\-\-solo\fP command line option, and JSON attributes are specified in the same way as for chef\-solo, with \fB\-j /path/to/chef\-solo.json\fP\&.
T}
_
T{
Client
T}	T{
seth\-shell acts as a chef\-client\&. During startup, it reads the chef\-client configuration file and contacts the Seth server to get attributes and cookbooks. The run list will be set in the same way as normal chef\-client runs. chef\-client mode is activated with the \fB\-z\fP or \fB\-\-client\fP options. You can also specify the configuration file with \fB\-c CONFIG\fP and the server URL with \fB\-S SERVER_URL\fP\&.
